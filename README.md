Prateek's Page 

I pickd a theme of brown, white a black
I am using html and CSS but plan to implent Java script as I make my way through the course

The offset shadow is on purpose, I thought it was a cool idea!


I decided to have a white, black, and brown theme. 

For the project that was suppose to be bigger than the other projects
I included two photos since I couldn't find a photo with a ratio I wanted. 

All the Projects, have an image of me at the moment but going forward, I wll chaning them to actual projects

All my anchor tags turn red, and they naviagete to their respective sections

I plan to change "my digits" to "contacts", I just did that for a bit of comic relief, if you will

CSS

The root for the CSS is pretty simple with primary and secondary color 

I tried to group things together in terms of shared styling 

While doing this project I learend a lot about inheritcnce 

Media Query 

The page is responsive,

The responsiveness of the page probably needs more attention
